{
  "intro": "You are in a cold, dark place",
  "wakeup": "Opening your eyes, you see the wreck of your ship and most of your crew dead around you. You have no idea how long you were out but some of your surviving crew have already woken up. Your ship is a total loss but you can salvage some parts and use them to build some shelter.",
  "firsthut": "You tell your remaining crew to gather materials and set up some temporary shelter. \"These huts will provide some basic shelter,\" you say to your crew. \"but we are going to need better shelter before we can start looking for a way home.\"",
  "largerhut": "More space means we can start learning more about where we are. This larger hut will be very useful.",
  "surroundings": "The crash cleared a large area of woods and jungle where we can build what a small base. There's debris everywhere. We should probably make sure we're safe in our huts first and then start exploring.",
  "junglenoises": "Late one night, two of your crew hear ruffling sounds from the nearby jungle. Something other than wind is out there. Maybe we should investigate. Or maybe they were just hearing things.",
  "junglenoises2": "This time, you were there yourself to hear the noises. There's definitely something out in the jungle. Maybe it's animals we can hunt for food, or maybe we'll be the hunted. We need to send out expeditions to discover the source of the noises and perhaps learn more about where we are.",
  "firstwounded": "During an expedition, one of the crew members stumbled and hurt themselves. Most likely it will not be the last wound. The crew member returned to camp but couldn't continue the expedition. We need to build a medical facility to treat the wounded",
  "medicalstation": "Searching through the wreckage, we found some medical kits that survived the crash. It won't last long and it will take a long time to heal anyone with only rudimentary equipment, but it's the best we have for now. Perhaps we can look for medical plants in the jungle",
  "sourceofnoises": "During an expedition, a crew member noticed a creature hiding in some bushes. When they approached, the creature ran away. The crew member said it looked like a humanoid creature.",
  "directionofalienship": "Using what we remember from telemetry before the crash as well as clues discovered during our expeditions, we believe we have found where the alien ship is located. It's far away and it will take time to find it. We need to send out larger and longer expeditions to learn more.",
  "medicinalplants": "Analyzing the nearby flora in the nearby jungle, we've managed to find some plants that seem to speed up wound recover and dull pain. The crew can use this to reduce casualties during expeditions. We can also start researching how to utilize those plants at the base.",
  "medicinalplantsbase": "\"Eureka!\" One of your crew members comes running up to you. \"We can synthesize basic medicines from local plants to help us heal the wounded! We can probably even build a rudimentary sickbay now!\" The mood of everyone rises at the prospect of less risk of long-term sickness.",
  "roadtoalienship": "We found it! It took a long time but one of our expeditions came back with the exact location of the alien ship. There's an amazing amount of knowledge we can learn now.",
  "kruattackfirst": "One day while we were having lunch, some of the humanoid creatures came running out of the jungle, attacking us. We had little time to prepare for the onslaught and having no weapons, we had to find rocks and debris to defend ourselves. Luckily, there were no fatalities and the creatures retreated into the jungle without causing permanent damage.",
  "kruattacksecond": "The creatures attacked again. This time, one of them got hurt and we managed to capture it before the others fled. We brought it back to camp and it made rudimentary noises before it succumbed to its wounds and died. Perhaps the noises were a language of some kind. Maybe we can capture one of them to learn how to communicate. ",
  "krucapture": "We found a way to capture a creature and keep it alive. We need to build a cage to keep it confined so we can learn more about this species. ",
  "medkits": "Thanks to the hard work of the crew, we found out how to make medkits out of the native medicinal plants. The kits will speed up recovery of wounded crew members. We need to send out expeditions to the the nearby jungle to find the raw materials, but we can now produce new medkits in sickbay. ",
  "medkitsout": "We ran out of medkits. Without medkits, recorvery from wounds will be much slower. ",
  "medkitsoutneedresearch": "We should research how to make more medkits. ",
  "medkitsoutcanbuild": "Luckily, we can build more medkits in sickbay now if we just get the raw materials from the nearby jungle. We'll convert medicinal plants to medkits when they are available.",
  "krucaptured": "During a particularly viscious attack this morning, we managed to incapacitate one of the creatures with a cargo net. We can start examining it to understand better what they are and possibly how to defend ourselves. ",
  "kruintro": "\"Fascinating!\" said one of the crew members responsible for examining the creature we captured. \"These creatures are far more primitive than us. Their physiology is very strange but actaully resembles ours. I cannot understand why. They seem to have a crude language. I believe I can begin to understand the basics if I can get some more time.\" ",
  "krunonaggressive": "The creatures keep attacking us but somehow they always retreat without doing serious damage. In fact, they seem very careful not to kill anyone, never attacking wounded crew members and always retreating when they have knocked someone out.",
  "krulanguagebasics": "\"I have started to understand the basics of their language.\" The crew member investigating the creature reported in. \"I have learned how it asks for food and that it has pain in its legs. From what I have been able to deduce, they call themselves K'ru.\"",
  "antennafound":  "\"CAPTAIN! CAPTAIN!\" One of the crew members you sent out on a deep jungle expeditions comes running back. \"We saw wreckage from the crash on the other side of a large valley! We think the antenna for the communications array is there!\" The crew member collapses after delivering the good news. We can send out expeditions to try to find it and possibly use it to repair our communications capabilities and call Earth for help!",
  "antennarecovered": "After weeks of expeditions searching, we finally found and recovered the antenna from out communications array. This is the first real chance we have of getting out of here. With the antenna, we can build a new communcations array and send a message back to Earth! In the meantime, however, we must continue our main mission, which is to discover the purpose of the alien ship.",
